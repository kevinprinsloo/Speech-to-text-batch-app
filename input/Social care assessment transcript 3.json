Do you have any communication preferences or specific requirements we should be aware of when conducting this assessment?\n\nMB: I prefer communication through video calls because I find it easier to lip-read and understand others that way.\n\nJB: Thank you for letting us know.

Where do you currently live, Martha?\n\nMB: I'm currently living in my own home in Hammersmith and Fulham.\n\nJB: How do you feel about your current living situation?\n\nMB: I feel quite content in my own home, but I could use a bit more support to make it safer.\n\nJB: Understood.

Speaking of mobility, can you move around your home safely and independently?\n\nMB: Yes, I can move around my home safely and independently.\n\nJB: Do you need any mobility aids or adaptations in your home to make it safer or more accessible?\n\nMB: At the moment, I don't require any mobility aids or home adaptations.\n\nJB: Are there any barriers to accessing the community or local services related to your mobility?\n\nMB: No, I can access the community and local services without any issues.\n\nJB: How about personal care?
